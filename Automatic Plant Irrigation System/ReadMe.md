# Automatic Plant Irrigation System

###  Our project is an automatic plant irrigation system. By measuring the moisture in the soil of the plant with the soil moisture sensor, if the moisture is below a certain level, it will water the plant with the help of a water pump. After watering until the moisture is ideal again, the motor will stop and the moisture will be displayed on the LCD screen momentarily.
